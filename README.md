# UK_hourly_net_salary_study
UK economy and household survey data analysis

The household survey data has a large number of columns, some of which have mixed data types. The script is a good example of cleaning and preprocessing exercise. The script imports several standard data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to perform common data manipulation and visualization tasks.

The hourly net salary study has been investigated using a OLS regression on a cross-secional dataset collected across multiple years.
